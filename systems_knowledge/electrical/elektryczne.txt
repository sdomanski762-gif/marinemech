BEFORE ANY WORK:
1. Turn OFF battery switch
2. Remove winch control pendant
3. Chock wheels if on trailer
4. Ensure no load on winch
5. Wear gloves (winches pinch!)
6. Keep clear of drum under power
BEFORE ANY WORK:
1. Turn OFF battery switch
2. Remove winch control pendant
3. Chock wheels if on trailer
4. Ensure no load on winch
5. Wear gloves (winches pinch!)
6. Keep clear of drum under power

LOGIC PATH:
IF [No sound at all when switch pressed]
THEN:

1. CHECK POWER AVAILABILITY:
   * Listen: Other 12V devices working? (Lights, radio)
   * If other devices dead → Check main battery/battery switch
   * If other devices work → Winch-specific problem

2. NO-TOOL VOLTAGE CHECK:
   * Find main winch power cables (usually heavy red/black)
   * Are they securely connected to battery?
   * Check for obvious corrosion/disconnection

3. SIMPLE JUMPER TEST:
   * Disconnect winch positive cable from battery
   * Momentarily touch to battery positive
   * Look for small spark (indicates draw)
   * Listen for solenoid "click"
   * IF spark/click → Winch has internal power
   * IF no spark → Open circuit in winch

4. CONTROL PENDANT CHECK:
   * Try different control if available
   * Bypass pendant: Touch winch motor wires directly
   * IF winch runs with direct power → Pendant/switch problem
   * IF still dead → Winch motor or solenoid problem

5. SOLENOID CHECK (listen for click):
   * Have someone press switch while ear near winch
   * Should hear distinct "CLICK" from solenoid
   * No click? → Solenoid or control circuit problem
   * Clicks but no movement? → Motor or connection problem
LOGIC PATH:
IF [Motor hums/runs but drum doesn't turn]
THEN:

1. IDENTIFY SOUND TYPE:
   * Loud buzzing/humming? → Stalled motor or mechanical jam
   * Normal running sound? → Gear train disconnect
   * Grinding noise? → Stripped gears

2. NO-LOAD TEST:
   * Disconnect load from winch
   * Try to run with no load
   * IF runs without load → Overloaded or mechanical bind
   * IF still doesn't turn → Internal mechanical failure

3. MANUAL OVERRIDE CHECK:
   * Most winches have manual override clutch
   * Engage/disengage clutch several times
   * Try different clutch positions
   * Listen/feel for engagement

4. EMERGENCY MANUAL OPERATION:
   * Insert winch handle (if equipped)
   * Can you turn manually?
   * If won't turn manually → Seized bearings or gears
   * If turns manually → Motor/gear coupling failure
LOGIC PATH:
IF [Works in but not out] OR [Works out but not in]
THEN:

1. CONTROL SWITCH TEST:
   * Swap direction switch if detachable
   * Test both directions at winch motor terminals
   * Direct power to motor terminals:
     - Connect + to A, - to B = one direction
     - Connect + to B, - to A = opposite direction
   * IF both directions work with direct power → Control problem
   * IF only one direction works → Motor or solenoid problem

2. SOLENOID LOGIC:
   * Two-direction winches have two solenoids
   * Listen for BOTH solenoids clicking
   * One direction clicks, other silent? → Bad solenoid or control
   * Both click? → Motor connection problem

3. SIMPLE SOLENOID BYPASS:
   * Find the two main motor terminals
   * To test IN: Jump battery + to one terminal, - to other
   * To test OUT: Reverse the connections
   * Wear gloves - sparks will occur!

LOGIC PATH:
IF [Winch runs but lacks power/speed]
THEN:

1. VOLTAGE DROP CHECK (critical for winches):
   * Observe lights when winch running
   * Lights dim severely? → Battery problem or undersized cables
   * Lights stay bright? → Winch internal problem

2. CABLE RESISTANCE CHECK:
   * Feel battery cables while winching
   * Warm/hot cables? → Undersized or corroded
   * Feel winch motor housing
   * Extremely hot? → Overheating motor

3. LOAD ASSESSMENT:
   * Is load heavier than normal?
   * Is winch angle changed? (more friction)
   * Is rope/layer binding?

4. LAYER MANAGEMENT CHECK:
   * First layer on drum has most power
   * Multiple layers reduce power 30-50%
   * Rewind to single layer if possible
LOGIC PATH:
IF [Winch gets very hot] OR [Breaker trips/fuse blows]
THEN:

1. DUTY CYCLE CHECK:
   * Most winches: 5 minutes ON, 15 minutes OFF
   * Have you been winching continuously?
   * Let cool completely (30+ minutes)

2. AMP DRAW ESTIMATION:
   * No ammeter? Use light dimming method:
     - With winch OFF: Note light brightness
     - Start winching: Observe dimming
     - Severe dimming = high draw
     - Moderate dimming = normal draw

3. MECHANICAL BINDING CHECK:
   * Disconnect load, run winch free
   * Still trips breaker? → Winch problem
   * Doesn't trip? → Load or mounting problem

4. BEARING CHECK:
   * Lift load slightly, spin drum by hand
   * Should spin freely with slight resistance
   * Grinding/stiff rotation? → Bad bearings
LOGIC PATH:
IF [Rapid clicking sound from winch]
THEN:

1. BATTERY VOLTAGE CHECK:
   * Clicking solenoid = low voltage
   * Check battery state of charge
   * Start engine to boost voltage

2. CONNECTION RESISTANCE:
   * Check ALL connections in winch circuit:
     - Battery terminals
     - Main power lugs
     - Ground connections
   * Clean any corrosion found

3. SOLENOID HOLD-IN POWER:
   * Some solenoids have separate hold circuits
   * If main contacts make but won't stay → Hold circuit problem
   * Temporary fix: Hold switch manually (carefully!)

   * Some solenoids have separate hold circuits
   * If main contacts make but won't stay → Hold circuit problem
   * Temporary fix: Hold switch manually (carefully!)
LOGIC PATH:
IF [Remote doesn't work] OR [Switch intermittent]
THEN:

1. CONTROL TYPE IDENTIFICATION:
   * Wired pendant? → Check cable continuity
   * Wireless remote? → Check batteries
   * Deck-mounted switch? → Check for water ingress

2. SIMPLE CONTINUITY TEST:
   * For wired controls:
     - Disconnect at winch end
     - Press switch, check continuity between wires
     - Should show continuity when pressed
   * For 5-pin common winch plugs:
     - Pin 1: Ground
     - Pin 2: Out
     - Pin 3: In
     - Pin 4: Not used
     - Pin 5: +12V

3. WATER INGRESS:
   * Submerged switch/control?
   * Dry thoroughly (rice bag if available)
   * Spray with corrosion inhibitor if available
IF [Solenoid failed but motor OK]
THEN:
  1. Identify main motor terminals (large studs)
  2. Create manual switch:
     - Two heavy screwdrivers
     - Insulated handles
     - Touch battery + to one terminal
     - Touch battery - to other terminal
     - REVERSE for opposite direction
  3. EXTREME CAUTION: Heavy sparks, wear gloves
  4. Only for emergency retrieval
