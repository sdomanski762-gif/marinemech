IF [Smell smoke/burning] OR [See sparks] OR [Feel heat on wires]
THEN:
  1. SHUT OFF main battery switch IMMEDIATELY
  2. If AC involved: Disconnect shore power/inverter
  3. Use fire extinguisher if needed
  4. Let system cool 15 minutes
  5. Proceed with caution
IF [No lights, no instruments, no sounds anywhere]
THEN:
  1. CHECK: Battery switch position

     * Parallel batteries if switch has BOTH position
     * IF works → Original battery dead1.           TEST: Battery voltage (touch probes to battery posts)
   * <10V → Battery dead
   * 10-12V → Low but should power something
   * >12V → Battery OK
   
2. FOLLOW THE VOLTAGE:
   * Test at battery switch INPUT side → Should match battery
   * Test at battery switch OUTPUT side → Should match if switch ON
   * Test at main panel main lug → Should have voltage
   
3. VOLTAGE DROP CHECK:
   * Connect one probe to battery NEGATIVE post
   * Other probe to engine block → Should be 0V
   * If voltage >0.5V → Bad engine ground
IF [Some lights work but others don't] OR [Instruments dead but cabin lights work]
THEN:

1. IDENTIFY PATTERN:
   * Everything on one side dead? → Check distribution panel fuses
   * All instruments dead? → Check instrument power bus
   * Individual circuit dead? → Isolate that circuit

2. NO-TOOL CIRCUIT TESTING:
   * Find working circuit on same panel

     * In rough seas → Vibration-related loose wire
     * After rain/damp → Moisture in connection
     * When warm/hot → Thermal expansion issue
     
  2. TAPPING TEST:
     * While working, gently tap along circuit

   * Belt tight? (Should depress about 1/2 inch)
   * Alternator wires connected?
   
2. SIMPLE VOLTAGE COMPARISON:
   * Note brightness of lights with engine OFF
   * Start engine, increase RPM to 1500
   * Lights should get slightly brighter
   * If no change → No charging
   
3. ALTERNATOR TEST (if ammeter available):
   * Turn ON all loads (lights, instruments)
   * Start engine, watch ammeter
   * Should show charge (needle to + side)
   
4. EMERGENCY FIELD EXCITATION (for old alternators):
   * Find small wire on alternator (usually labeled "FLD" or "F")
   * Momentarily touch to battery positive
   * If alternator starts charging → Regulator problem
   * WARNING: Don't hold wire on positive
IF [Batteries die quickly] OR [Won't hold charge]
THEN:

1. SIMPLE LOAD TEST:
   * Turn on cabin lights (several)
   * Watch brightness over 30 minutes
   * If dim quickly → Poor battery
   
2. EQUALIZATION CHECK (flooded batteries):
   * Check each cell fluid level

3. PARASITIC DRAW DETECTION:
   * Turn EVERYTHING OFF
   * Listen for any relays clicking
   * Feel for warm wires/boxes
   * Disconnect suspicious circuits one by one
   
4. OFFSHORE BATTERY MANAGEMENT:
   * Use one battery for engine start only

   * Feel for abrupt changes in flexibility
   
2. SIMPLE CONTINUITY TEST:
   * Strip both ends of wire
   * Connect to small battery (AA)
